# jutsu.matrix

You can install this library from clojars:
```clojure
[hswick/jutsu.matrix "0.0.1"]
```

This primarily serves as a light wrapper around nd4j linalg module and provides basic linear algebra support to those using ND4J arrays.

Most functions have been implemented. If for some reason you don't see a particular one feel free to submit a PR! :D
# Usage

Run `boot night` to startup nightlight and begin editing your project in a browser.

Run `boot test-code` to run your tests
